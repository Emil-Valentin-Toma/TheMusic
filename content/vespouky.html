<p class="anyBox" style="width:40%">$3.7m doesn't seem much in this world of Stradivarius domination. What is unusual though is that the violin was made by Efferini Vespouky himself, after he started to suffer from Parkinson condition. Not only he made it right, but the violin's sound is warm and strong and the artist enchanted the auditorium interpreting Vivaldi and Porumbescu with it, playing also notoriously difficult chord jumps. As such, the expectation for a good bid was high, but what followed was overwhelming. The money rised is a surprise for everyone and the charity representatives are elated. "As soon as the first bid over a million was rised, we couldn't believe ourselves.", DeRonin Sandra, one of the charity bosses says. She continues: "It was so emotional, people didn't lose empathy for becoming artists with Parkinson, who otherwise would drop out with tremendous negative impact to their lives. Thank you Efferini and hearted thanks to all of our sponsors!"</p> </article>
