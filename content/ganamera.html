<p class="anyBox" style="width:40%"> Ganamera, of Oxford, was found in childhood with total hearing loss after an antibiotic overdose. In order to protect her intelect from degradation, her parents trained her to "listen" through a matrix of small vibrating pads attached to the wrists. Each vibrating pad of the matrix is crafted (weighted) for a specific frequency, so actually the sounds are accoustically "drawn" on her wrist, in an unique combination of tickling spots. Wearing both matrices would improve directionality as well. The inventor also thinks of dropping the heavy transducers and use electrodes instead. That would also bring more miniaturization, therefore a higher resolution. The invention is patent pending and helps Ganamera, just turned 18, to serve in the mission of becoming the youngest ambassador for talented children with disabilities. She masters piano and her mission will be supported by an impressive apparatus of specialists and psychologists. "We can't see a future without integration", she says in a well articulated speech. She addressed the conclusion to the elated auditorium who later ovated her dedication for the cause: "Every single one of us has something to offer, just give us the chance and the means."</p> </article>
