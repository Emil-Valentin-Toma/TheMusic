        In the following contract, the creator of this website, or shortly, the author, is Emil Toma.
        
        The user is you, the visitor and user of the services this website hosts.
        
        This website is a proof of concept and the content is the produce of author's imagination. The user should read it and use it accordingly. That means, and is not limited to:
        <ul>
        
            <li>not to attempt to call the imaginary phone numbers;</li>
            <li>not to send any letter to the imaginary address mentioned on the website;</li>
            <li>not to attempt to visit or recommend the imaginary business;</li>
            <li>not to cite or forward the articles without the express permission of the author;</li>
        </ul>
        
        All of the above conditions are set because of a very small probability of coincidence with real life names, phone numbers and adresses. Also citing and forwarding the articles with these imaginary context and characters can and will deceive people who are not aware of mock up, bringing prejudice and damage to everyone. Please don't do it!<br>
        The material used in this site (text, photographs and drawings) is copyright Emil Toma unless otherwise mentioned in title tag or in clear (if quoted from external source). The material that doesn't belong to the author is free to use according to their source.<br>
        
        N.B.: The concept of the matrix made out of acoustic pads (MEMS)/small electrodes in Ganamera's article is inspired by the author's actual professional experience. Should you be interested in starting to research or manufacture this product, please do contact the author. Thank you!
